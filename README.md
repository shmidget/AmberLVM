<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 align="center">About The Project</h2>

<p align="center">Amber is a Language Virtual Machine meant to execute Amber Byte Code, similar to how the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) executes bytecode, this project will serve as a base for me to write several compilers and interpreters to run on the ALVM (Amber Language Virtual Machine) for compatability across several architectures, meaning you can write a compiler for ALVM any Programming Language by compiling to  Bytecode, avoiding the use of Compiler Toolchains. eg LLVM.</p>




### Built With:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

1. The Amber Virtual Machine is currently not avaliable for download.




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage of Amber Byte Code

   ```c
$ = Register

load $1 int32 32 -> Load 32 into Register 1
load $1 int32 2 -> Load Register 2 into Register 1

jmp int32 2 -> Jump to line 2

cmp $1 $2 -> Comparison of Register 1 and 2, Stores either 0 or 1 in $0 

je $1 $2 -> Jump Equals
jne $1 $2 -> Jump Not Equals

jg $1 $2 -> Jump Greater Than
jl $1 $2 -> Jump Less Than

jge $1 $2 -> Jump Greater Than Equals To
jle $1 $2 -> Jump Less Than Equals To

start .main
	load $0 int32 32
end .main
   ```
